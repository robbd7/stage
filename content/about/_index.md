Robb Hagle is a Fort Collins–based singer-songwriter whose music lives at the intersection of memory and myth. Rooted in fingerstyle guitar and the American folk tradition, his songs carry the hushed intimacy of personal storytelling and the dusty footprints of older roads. Drawing inspiration from artists like Bob Dylan, Elliott Smith, and Townes Van Zandt, Robb’s music blends introspective poetry with the tactile warmth of analog recording — each song feeling as if it were unearthed from a box of forgotten tapes.

Originally from Chicago, Robb began performing in bands two decades ago before turning to solo acoustic work in pursuit of something more direct and unvarnished. After falling in love with the raw honesty of outsider songwriters like Daniel Johnston, he found his voice in the folk idiom — one that honors imperfection, truth, and the continuity of shared songs. His forthcoming album, 20th Century Boy, revisits classic folk songs and personal favorites from his childhood, reimagined through vintage gear and traditional recording methods inspired by Folkways’ golden age.

Now based in Colorado, Robb draws on the quiet mysticism of the mountains and the long echoes of Appalachian songcraft. Whether playing an old standard or an original, his music invites listeners to slow down, feel the grain of the wood, and remember something they thought they’d forgotten.
